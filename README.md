# Gambling_Underground
Gambling_Underground is my C++ personal coding project in which I aim to eventually create 5 gambling games utilizing a card deck

The entire project is a work in progress and is more of 5 projects put into one.

The currentlly implemented and finished game is War of Cards, which is similar to BlackJack in some manners in which the user will draw cards to get as close to thirty and face off against the dealer. The game features a 52 standard card deck, 4 jokers, and a special multiplier card type, and also special hands that will increase the user's potential rewards.

My personal inspiration/motivation to create this project is because I desire to demonostrate my coding skills, I want to learn more about coding and feel practice and research is one of the best ways to learn, I want to be a game developer as my future career, and I like the style and rules of gambling games in real life.
